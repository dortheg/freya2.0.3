HOW TO BUILD THE LLNL FISSION LIBRARY
-------------------------------------
To compile the fission library (will be installed in local directory "lib"):
   make

Optional:
   To test the library and compare to reference output
      make test

See src/Readme for expert build instructions

HOW TO BUILD A SAMPLE CODE
--------------------------
Follow the example in recipe

HEADER FILES:
-------------
To invoke the fission library from a c/c++ code, add the following
header to your code
        #include "Fission.h" (c)
        #include "Fission.hh" (c++)
and invoke the functions described in the header file to generate
fission reactions and return their parameters.
The most important functions are as follows:
        extern void genspfissevt_(int *isotope, double *time);
        extern void genfissevt_(int *isotope, double *time, double *nubar, double *eng);
        extern void genphotofissevt_(int *isotope, double *time, double *nubar, double *eng);
generate spontaneous, neutron- and photon- induced fission reactions, respectively. 
The functions
        extern int getnnu_();
        extern int getpnu_();
return the number of neutrons and gamma-rays for that fission reaction.
        extern double getneng_(int *index);
        extern double getpeng_(int *index);
return the energies of the fission neutrons and gamma-rays.

The seed of the default random number generator can be set explicitely using
        void seed(unsigned short int s[3])

To invoke the fission library from a FORTRAN code, add the following 
header file to your code:
	#include "Fission.inc"
and invoke the functions as above (without the trailing underscore _).


HOW TO LINK TO THE FISSION LIBRARY:
-----------------------------------
To link in libFission.a/libFission.so, compile the main code with
        -lFission
preceded by the path to the library on the compile line.

For the shared library libFission.so: at run time, set the following 
variables 
        export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../lib
        export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=../lib # MacOSX
to be the path to the library.

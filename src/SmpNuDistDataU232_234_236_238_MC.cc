  Description
    Sample Number of Neutrons from fission in U-232, U-234, U-236,

    The 11 P(nu) distributions are given as a function of nubar, 
    the average number of neutrons from induced fission for the 
    11 different energies (0 to 10 MeV), based on the U-238 data 
    from Zucker and Holden.

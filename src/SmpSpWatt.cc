  Description
    Sample Watt Spectrum for spontaneous fissions as in TART (Kalos algorithm) for 
        Th-232, 
        U-232, U-233, U-234, U-235, U-236, U-238
        Np-237, 
        Pu-238, Pu-239, Pu-240, Pu-241,  Pu-242
        Am-241, 
        Cm-242, Cm-244, 
        Bk-249,
        Cf-252
    based on Ensslin's data.
    N. Ensslin, et.al., "Application Guide to Neutron Multiplicity Counting," 
    LA-13422-M (November 1998) and
        Pu-236
    based on the assumption that Pu-236 has the same Watt spectrum as Np-237 
    since they have approximately the same nubar (2.05 versus 2.07). We think
    this assumption is valid since Dermott Cullen showed in "Sampling ENDL Watt 
    Fission Spectra," UCRL-TR-203251 that the Watt fission spectra can very well
    be approximated with a single parameter a by setting b equal to 1, instead 
    of 2 parameters a and b. He showed this for neutron-induced fissions. Since
    there is only 1 parameter characterizing a Watt spectrum, Watt spectra with
    identical nubars must have the same value for that parameter a (that is 
    because the integral of the spectrum with respect to the energy gives nubar, 
    normalization excluded). If we assume that Watt spectra can be approximated 
    by a single parameter a for spontaneous fissions as well (which I verified 
    and it seems to be a valid assumption), there can only be a single Watt 
    spectrum for a given nubar_sp. I thus concluded that the Watt spectrum for 
    Pu-236 is close to the Watt spectrum for Np-237.

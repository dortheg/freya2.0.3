double fissionEvent::getTotEngP(double ePart, double nubar, int isotope, int A, int Z, bool spontaneous) {

  Description
    Returns the average total energy available to prompt fission gamma-rays.
    Depending on the value of fissionEvent::effectivecorrelationoption,
    this energy will be computed 1 of 4 ways:
    switch (fissionEvent::effectivecorrelationoption)
       case(0): the average total energy is the one of Tim Valentine's 
                model described in T.E. Valentine, "Evaluation of Prompt 
                 Fission Gamma Rays for Use in Simulating Nuclear 
                 Safeguard Measurements," Ann. Nucl. Eng., 28, 191 
                (2001).
       case(1): the average total energy is determined by sampling a 
                normal distribution of mean <Etot_p> and standard 
                deviation <Etot_p>/8, where <Etot_p> is given in B. Beck, 
                D.A. Brown, F. Daffin, J. Hedstrom, R. Vogt, 
                "Implementation of Energy-Dependent Q Values for 
                 Fission," UCRL-TR-234617, Lawrence Livermore National 
                Laboratory (2007).
       case(2): the average total energy is determined by sampling a 
                normal distribution of mean <Etot_p> and standard 
                deviation <Etot_p>/8, where <Etot_p> is given in R. Vogt, 
                "Energy-Dependent Fission Q Values Generalized for All 
                 Actinides," LLNL-TR-407620, Lawrence Livermore 
                National Laboratory (2008).
       case(3): the average total energy is irrelevant and set to 0, 
                energies are determined independently by FREYA in this 
                case.
    For spontaneous fissions, the average total energy available to 
    prompt fission gamma-rays is computed via T.E. Valentine's method.

  Input
    ePart       - energy of incoming neutron causing fission. If it is 
                  equal to -1, it means this is a spontaneous fission
    nubar       - average number of fission neutrons
    isotope     - isotope
    A           - number of nuclei in atom, if set to -1, A and Z need
                  to be computed
    Z           - number of protons in atom, if set to -1, Z and Z need
                  to be computed
    spontaneous - set to true for spontaneous fissions

  Output
    getTotEngP - average total energy available to prompt fission

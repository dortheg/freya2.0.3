  Description
    Determine the average total energy of prompt neutrons emitted by fission.

    The data in this function comes from the paper "Implementation of Energy-
    Dependent Q Values for Fission" by R. Vogt, B. Beck, D.A. Brown, F. Daffin,
    and J. Hedstrom. The paper gives the total energy for all emitted prompt 
    fission neutrons. Data in the paper is given for the following 3 isotopes:
    U-235, U-238, Pu-239.
    The average total prompt fission neutron energy is given as a function of 
    the incident neutron energy with the formula:
       NEng = VogtNeutron[0] + VogtNeutron[1] * ePart

  Description
    Returns the average total energy available to prompt fission neutrons.
    Depending on the value of fissionEvent::effectivecorrelationoption,
    this energy will be computed 1 of 3 ways:
    switch (fissionEvent::effectivecorrelationoption)
       case(1): the average total energy is determined by sampling a 
                normal distribution of mean <Etot_n> and standard 
                deviation <Etot_n>/4, where <Etot_n> is given in B. Beck, 
                D.A. Brown, F. Daffin, J. Hedstrom, R. Vogt, 
                "Implementation of Energy-Dependent Q Values for 
                 Fission," UCRL-TR-234617, Lawrence Livermore National 
                Laboratory (2007).
       case(2): the average total energy is determined by sampling a 
                normal distribution of mean <Etot_n> and standard 
                deviation <Etot_n>/4, where <Etot_n> is given in R. Vogt, 
                "Energy-Dependent Fission Q Values Generalized for All 
                 Actinides," LLNL-TR-407620, Lawrence Livermore 
                National Laboratory (2008).
       default: the average total energy is irrelevant and set to 0.
    For spontaneous fissions, the average total energy available to 
    prompt fission neutrons is computed via T.E. Valentine's method.

  Description
    Sample Number of Neutrons from fission in U-233 and U-235 using 
    (a) Gwin, Spencer and Ingle tabulated data at thermal 
        energies (0 MeV),
    (b) Zucker and Holden's tabulated data for U-235 at 1 MeV and 
        higher.
    The P(nu) distribution is given as a function of the average 
    number of neutrons from fission, based on interpolation of the 
    U-235 data above.

  Input
    nubar    - average number of neutrons per fission

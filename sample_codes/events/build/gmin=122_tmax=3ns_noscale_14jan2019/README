10**6 fissions for the values, 10**6/10 for uncertanty calculation

No scaling factor in gamma spectrum

Correct handling of multichance fission, splits gammas into whether they come from first, second or third chance fission

I noticed that something started to misbehave in the neutron calculation for 10^6 iterations for one specific excitation energy, which is why the neutron spectrum is only run with 10^5 events
